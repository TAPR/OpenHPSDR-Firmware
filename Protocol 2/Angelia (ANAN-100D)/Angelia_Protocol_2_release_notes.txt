		- works - saved as today's date _2 (and ping works!). 
	29 	- Added items from Alex's network code to SDC file. Changed PHY delay to 1.2nS and updated sdc. 
		- NR = 7, Receivers OK but not Sync.  Changed PHY delay back to 2nS. 
		- By forcing Rx1 phase word to Rx0 phase word then all receivers OK and Sync works. 
		- Try selecting Rx1 phase word dependent on Sync[0] setting. Runs but possible Sync problem.
     Jul 2 	- Revert to normal phase word selection. Receivers appear to work but not sure about Sync.
		- Saved as today's date and sent to Warren etc for testing. 
	3 	- Warren reports that Rx1 and Rx5 seem to share the same frequency - confirmed - no idea why!  Unrolled Rx generation - no change.
	4 	- Unroll frequency selection in Hi Priority C&C, seems to have fixed the same frequency problem.
		- Saved as today's date and sent to Kirk for assistance.
		- Code just stops running for some reason. 
	21 	- Changed phy_cfg to turn off Tx delay and set Rx delay to F0 or C0 or 00 - all seem to work the same. 
	22 	- Changed phy_cfg to use different Rx clock delays.
		- Changed sdc to use different PHY data_in settings.  Checked 7 receivers appears OK, still not sure about Sync. 
		- Saved as today's date.
	23 	- Changed KK so that each receiver can be set to different frequency. Works but some receivers fail when chip is cold.
		- Try unfolding Rx generation.  Appears to work OK, ping works for a few mins until FPGA warms up. 
		- Saved as today's date and sent to Warren for testing.
	25 	- force same phase word to Rx0 and Rx1. Sync works but phase offset.  
				   - Force CORDIC reset when selecting Sync - no difference
					
	____________________________________________________________________________-
					
		- Two receiver version to speed up debug.
		- force Rx1 to use Rx0 phase word when in Sync mode - works OK.
		- force CIC reset when selecting sync - works OK.
		- force FIR reset when selecting sync - Rx hangs when Sync selected. 
		- independent phase words for Rx0 and Rx1 - not work
		- change High_Priority_CC so that Rx0 and Rx1 phase words are captured at the same time. Works until Rx1 is tuned.
					- when Sync active force Rx1 phase word to equal Rx0 phase word - wont run! see line 1038.
		- try setting Rx1 phase word  = Rx0 phase word  in High_Priority_CC when Sync active - no change
	26 	- try reset CORDIC phase to zero when reset active. Works until you change frequency then need to set Sync again.
		- remove reset code from High_Priority_CC  - same result.
		- remove reset from CIC filters - same result.
		- try just reseting CORDIC phase rather than other variables - same result.
		- use cdc_mcp to move receiver phase words to Rx clock domain - same result i.e. works until you change frequency.
		- use Sync to force Rx1 = Rx0 phase word - when you select Sync no Rx data sent?
		- force code to read phase at same time - using cdc_mcp - not work 
		- try using cdc_sync - works, can drag tune very slowly and phase preserved.
		- set Rx1 = Rx0 phase word - code not run 
		- revert to separate Rx0 and Rx1 phase words. 
		- set Rx1 = Rx0 in High_Priority_CC - code runs but phase not work.
		- revert to separate Rx0 and Rx1 phase words.
	27 	- Also reset CORDIC when new phase word arrives using Alex_data_ready - will not start.
		- Just use Alex_data_ready - Rx always at 0Hz, reasonable since as soon as new phase word is received it is set to zero. 
		- Move Alex_data_ready stobe to just before new Rx0 and Rx1 phase words.  Works most of the time but can tune such that phases are not correct.
		- Try Alex_data_ready directly after new Rx phases - works but blip in Rx audio as you tune not unexpectedly.
		- Try right at end - works OK. Sync does not hold after changing sampling rates.
	29 	- Force Rx1 = Rx0 sample rate. Sync OK when changing sample rates.
		- Force Rx1 = Rx0 sample rate from KK as well as Rx0 = Rx1 frequency.  Sync OK when changing sampling rate.
		- Try setting Rx1 = Rx0 phase when Sync set again - remove reset of phase accumalator when frequency changes - WORKS!!!

	2 	- Sent to Warren for testing.
	5 	- Fixed bug in Wideband_packets_per_frame. Added Wideband_update_rate. Sync not work!  Was 70

	8 	- modified ping check sum - not work and Rx0 not work. Ping error is due to incorrect data being received.
	9 	- modified ping code to use dual clock fifo and clock tx side on negedge. Ping works but not Sync.

                              - replaced max clock delays for RX_clock with mulitpath
            21  - used icmp.v and icmp_fifo.v from Hermes-Lite project. Ping sometimes works, when fails payload is wrong.
                              - updated dhcp.v from Hermes-Lite project. Works OK.

2018    Feb  10  - Merged files from Hermes-Lite project and those provided by Rick, N1GP.
                                   - Fixed bug that caused non response to Discovery request.
                                   - retimed
                                   - set version to 11.7
                                   - Archived project as Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.7-Quartus-17
                                   - removed almost_full and almost_empty flags since no longer required by Simon, G4ELI, SDR-Radio software
                                   - corrected text explaining external 10MHz reference operation
                                   - released as 11.7 and archived as before.
        Mar    3 - set Rx1 input = DAC data for Thetis debug testing
                         - // Remove ability for other than Rx1 to receive DAC data since not supported by other HW at the moment.
                                   - Modified sdr_send so that phy_ready requires no pending data from Rx0 fifo.
                                   - Rx1 now has input data selectable again.
                                   - Added Samplerate input to mux_clear to reset code if sample rate changes
                                   - modified mux_clear such that either Mux or SampleRate changing state runs code.
                                   - Remove ability for other than Rx1 to receive DAC data since not supported by other HW at the moment.
                                 4 - Remove fifo_empty from mux_clear since can hang in that state otherwise.
                                   - Added mux_clear fifo_clear output to reset DDC0 and DDC1 - no improvement.
                                 7 - Testing Diverstity - set DEBUG_LED10 = C122_SyncRx[0][1] to confirm signal from Thetis - looks OK.
                                10 - Force DDC0 and DDC1 to have same sampling rate when Mux active
                              - set DEBUG_LED10 to indicate amplitude difference between DDC0 and DDC1 when in Mux mode.

2019    Mar  2 - (N1GP) Worked with Chris/W2PA and Doug/W5WC on an issue with FPGA_PTT
                           coming in late and cutting off the beginning of the CW_char.
                           Or'd FPGA_PTT with Alex_data[27] assigned to runsafe_Alex_data,
                           added mixing of rx audio with sidetone during CW_PTT and break_in,
                           QSK much improved.
                         - Added latching of data in initial states of SPI, TLV320_SPI, and Attenuator.
                         - Added a checksum in the send_more reply to a Host programmer to validate image transfer.

2019    Mar 30 - (N1GP) Changed to 4 rx's as it's easier to compile and make timing.
                           Upgraded to Quartus 18.1
                         - Changed FW version number to v1.18
