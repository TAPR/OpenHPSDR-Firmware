This is firmware meant for a single Mercury and Metis board. The frequency range
is up to 30MHz and is fixed at 192ksps. This is due to using an NCO -vs- Cordic
and only using CIC filters in the DSP. This uses less FPGA resources and allow
many more receivers. This was inspired by the Hermes-Lite2 folks as they put
together a 10 receiver slice firmware for use with skimming. That would include
clients such as:

CW Skimmer / Skimmer Server:

	https://www.dxatlas.com/SkimServer

This firmware provides up to 8 receiver slices (or DDCs) @ 192ksps. It is Protocol 2
based.
