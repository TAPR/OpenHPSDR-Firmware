Hermes Protocol 2 release notes:

2015 Aug  8 	- Start porting from Angelia, 2 Receivers.
		- set PHY Rx_clock delay to 60. 	Works!
		- test ICMP, changed Rx on posedge, works initally but fails after starting KK.
	9	- flash LED10 if icmp_rx_enable active.  Only active when icmp data valid.
		- Alex data not been seen.  
		- Saved as today's date.
		- Move Alex data flag to correct location.  .a_data_rdy(Alex_ready)
	10 	- Added CW Break-in control.  Inhibit FPGA_PTT and RF generation if break_in not active.
		- Saved as today's date.
	12 	- Closed timing except minimum pulse width.
		- Saved as today's date.
	Sep  4 	- Imported changes from Angelia code.
		- Saved as today's date.
		- include High_Priority_CC from Angelia code. 
		- Prevent Quartus merging PLLs so that VCXO phase locks to 10MHz correctly. Set Auto Merge PLLs off. 
		- Corrected clock source for Alex data.
	      5 - Added Alex code from Angelia.
		- saved as today's date.
		- redo timing
		- saved as today's date.	
	      7 - Released to VK0S to test new programmer code.
	     12 - Updated from Angelia code i.e. 10MHz PLL locked to C&C data, 
			Set protocol version to 1.6.  24,980 LEs.
		- Saved as today's date.
	     13 - Redo timing. No Rxs
		- NR = 1.
	     16 - Padded sdr_send.v so that Discovery, erase and program replies are the same length.
	     19 - Using receiver3.v and NR = 3, 89% full. Works but can't set individual sample rates
		- Redo timing. NR = 3 not reliable.
		- NR = 2, receiver2.v  
		- need to redo timing.
		- CURRENT CODE uses 2 Rx with receiver2.v 
	     26 - Working on erase code to see why it sometimes does not respond 
		- (EPCS_state) now on posedge of clock.
		- connect ASMI busy and (erase | erase_done) to DEBUG_LEDs  - seems to be more reliable.
		- ASMI_interface was using negedge - change to posedge - erase done is faster?
	     27	- Connect busy from ASMI_interface to .erase_ACK input on sdr_receive.v.  Since 
			in different clock domains erase signal will remain active until ASMI_interface starts erasing EEPROM. 
		- Erase now works every time.
		- Saved as today's date.
	     30 - Added Mux for Rx0 and Rx1 for PureSignal use. 
		- Saved as today's date.
	Oct  16 - Moved ASMI_interface back to negedge	as per Angelia 
		- Saved as today's date.

			profile.v line 102
			receiver2.v lines 70 - 75  (rate0)
			Hermes.v line 278 (instead of using the C construct, it should read 
			 "sec_count <= sec_count + 28'd1;"	Valid in SystemVerilog?
		- Added I05 amplifier tune input. 
	     28 - Added IO4 input for Tx inhibit and user analogue input 1 for external PA protection.
		- Modify hardware time out to sec_count >= 28'd250...

	     29 - More feedback from Scotty. WA2DFI
		- Removed use of x++ (since is blocking) at line 295 and in sdr_send.v lines 172, 182, 192 and 202 
		- Removed error messages relating to Data[1]/ASDO, FLASH_nCE/nCSO, DCLK and Data[0] pins by setting them to "Use as regular I/O".
		- Inhibit RF output if IO4 is low. 
		- Fixed sequence number error in srd_send.v,  bits [31:24] of sequence numbers not being sent. 
		- Saved as today's date and released for testing. 
	Feb   7 - Start of 100T version. 
		- J13 low sets PHY in 100T mode.
		- Set MODE2 = 0 for 100T.

	     20 - DAC clock set to posedge and 
	Apr  28 - DAC clock on negedge, PHY_TX[*] changed in Hermes.sdc

		- Still have sidebands at +/- 48kHz
		- try DAC test code from Minerva.
	     17	- Fixed, was using rx_clock to clock DAC current which @ 100T is too slow, now use PHY_CLK125

		- saved as today's date and release for testing.
2017      Mar 2 - Merged changes from Angelia V10.9. i.e. dhcp.v, network.v, ip_recv.v, icmp.v, icmp_fifo.v to fix DHCP issues. 
		- Add assign IF_rst = network_state since just one bit now. 
		- added an additional bit to the following FIFOs usedw port so that they don't appear empty when actually full: 
			EPCS_fifo (increased used word sizes to [10:0]EPCS_Rx_used, [10:0]EPCS_wrused) NOTE: need to increase register in ASMI_interface.v
			Rx_fifo (increased used word sizes to [11:0] Rx_used[0:NR-1])
			Tx1_IQ_fifo (increased used word size to [12:0]write_used)
		- PS works but only if both receiver sample rates are set the same. Possible Thetis issue?
