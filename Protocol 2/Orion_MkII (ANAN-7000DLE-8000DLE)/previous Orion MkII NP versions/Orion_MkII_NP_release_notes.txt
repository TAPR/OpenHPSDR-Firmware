	Feb 11	- port from Orion_MkII_NP_v2.2 (uses software-selectable ADC/DDC assignments)
		- replaced entire Ethernet folder with Ethernet folder from Orion_MkII_NP_v0.2
			to capture the DHCP lease renewal fixes of v0.2
		- changed network_state to match v0.2 DHCP lease renewal fixes of v0.2
		- changed DACD to correctly form the offset binary format for the MAX5891 DAC
		- added IO4 inhibit to DACD assignment to zero DACD when IO4 is asserted
		- removed debounce_PTT from input conditions of FPGA_PTT assignment, to prevent possible
			pops/clicks of audio on Rx-to-Tx transitions
		- changed version number to v0.3
		- removed all max/min delay constraints in Orion.sdc, re-compiled, retimed/compiled
			iteratively until closed timing achieved
					
	Mar 6 	- modified the following megafunctions to add an additional MSB to fix the empty fifo problem
			Rx_fifo: increased Rx_used to [11:0] Rx_used[0:NR-2]
			Rx_Audio_fifo (although usedw not implemented in Orion.v)
			SP_fifo (although usedw not implemented in Orion.v)
			Tx1_IQ_fifo: increased write_used to [12:0] write_used in Orion.v
			(Mic_fifo: additional MSB bit was previously implemented)
		- zero'd the two LSBs of DACD before conversion to offset binary format
		- changed almost_full and almost_empty code for Tx1_IQ_fifo to fix sporadic Tx halts
		- changed version number to v0.4
		- changed protocol version number to v3.3
		- removed all max/min delay constraints
		- iteratively compiled, retimed until timing met

	Mar 9	- fixed ASMI code for EPCS128 larger bootloader area (2MB vs 1MB),
			increased erase boundary to 6MB, set FPGA image starting position at 2MB
		- changed firmware version number to v0.5 (released for testing)

		- changed FW version number to v0.6
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed (released for testing)

	Mar 17	- changed bit size of C122_cordic_i_output to 23 bits
		- changed method of converting from signed binary to offset binary for DACD
		- added a one-spi-clock delay to SPI.v code when the Alex_SPI_Tx data word changes
			to allow the data word to become stable before sending it to the bus
		- changed FW version to v0.7
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 18	- removed yesterday's on-spi-clock delay coding in SPI.v
		- modified SPI.v to send Alex data word twice when the Alex data word changes
		- changed FW version number to v0.8
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed					

	Mar 19	- changed CTRL_TRSW assignment to: 
			assign CTRL_TRSW = FPGA_PTT && XVTR_ENABLE;
		- corrected line 281 in send_sdr.v to send only 60 bytes total for CC_data
		- corrected definition of CC_data to 8 bits wide by 56 words deep:
			wire [7:0]CC_data[0:55]
		- added User_ADC1 (AIN3) and User_ADC2 (AIN4) to CC_data, available on both Rx and Tx				
		- assigned user digital inputs to byte 55 of CC_data in CC_encoder.v (via User_IO) as follows:
			byte 55[0] = IO4 input
			byte 55[1] = IO5 input
			byte 55[2] = IO6 input
			byte 55[3] = IO8 input
			byte 55[4] = IO2 input
			byte 55[5] = not assigned
			byte 55[6] = not assigned
			byte 55[7] = not assigned
			which when incorporated and sent out in the High Priority Status packet via sdr_send.v
			conforms to the new-protocol specification for byte 59 user inputs: 
			byte 59[0] = IO4 input
			byte 59[1] = IO5 input
			byte 59[2] = IO6 input
			byte 59[3] = IO8 input
			byte 59[4] = IO2 input
			byte 59[5] = not assigned
			byte 59[6] = not assigned
			byte 59[7] = not assigned
		- added byte 1400 to the High_Priority_CC packet as follows:
			byte 1400[0] = XVTR_enable (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)
			byte 1400[1] = IO1 output to enable/mute audio (0=audio enabled, 1= mute)
			byte 1400[2] = not assigned
			byte 1400[3] = not assigned
			byte 1400[4] = not assigned
			byte 1400[5] = not assigned
			byte 1400[6] = not assigned
			byte 1400[7] = not assigned
