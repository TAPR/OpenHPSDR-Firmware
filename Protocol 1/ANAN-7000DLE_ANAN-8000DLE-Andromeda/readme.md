All 7000DLE, 8000DLE and Andromeda units shipped from Apache BEFORE 1 July 2022, with serial numbers lower than DX8300497A, use Orion MKII firmware.

All 7000DLE and Andromeda units shipped from Apache AFTER 1 July 2022, with serial numbers DX8300497A or higher, use Orion MKIII firmware.


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MKII and MKIII

As of 1 July 2020, parts availability/obsolescence issues forced a change to the FPGA part number.

The MKII boards built before 1 July 2020 use an EP4CGX150F896. The MKIII boards built after 1 July 2020 use an EP4CE115F29C8N.

The MKIII also have part number changes associated with the PHY and VCXO chips but that does not affect firmware. The the MKII and MKIII boards are otherwise identical.

The MKII and MKIII firmware is otherwise identical, the MKIII version has only administrative changes necessary to work with the different FPGA.
