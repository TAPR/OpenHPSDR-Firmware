		- modified automatic-mode switch points in HPF_select.v and BPF2_select.v to:
			...
			if (frequency <  1500000) 	HPF <= 7'b0100000;   	// bypass
			else if	(frequency <  2100000) 	HPF <= 7'b0010000;	// RX BPF1 160M	
			else if (frequency <  5500000)	HPF <= 7'b0001000;	// RX BPF2 80M/60M

			else 				HPF <= 7'b1000000;	// LNA, active above 35MHz
			...
		- removed C10_PLL
		- changed C122_PLL/.c0 output to 10.000MHz
		- changed 122.88 MHz module lock XOR feedback to operate at 10MHz vs 80KHz
		- added C122_PLL_SHIFT to obtain a phase shifted 122.88MHz clock for DACD (TxDAC) generation
		- replaced ASMI constraints in Angelia.sdc using the v16.0 AMSI path versions to constrain 
			the new I/O ports/paths
		- set the PLL_IF outputs to:
			PLL_IF/.c0 = 48 MHz
			PLL_IF/.c1 = 12.288 MHz
			PLL_IF/.c2 = 3.072 MHz 90 deg phase shift
			PLL_IF/.c3 = 48 KHz
		- set C122_SHIFT_PLL/.c0 = 122.88 MHz with 15 deg phase shift
		- removed all max/min delay timing constraints in Angelia.sdc, compiled
		- closed timing, re-compiled
		- removed clean_PTT_in as an input to FPGA_PTT to prevent PTT timing problems with software
		- changed Alex SPI.v to send ALex data once for each time the Alex data word changes
		- changed version number to v1.1
		- removed all max/min delay timing constraints in Angelia.sdc, compiled
		- closed timing
			
	Feb 22	- port to Quartus Prime Lite v16.1
		- upgraded all megafunctions to v16.1 megafunctions
		- changed ADC0 attenuator assignment logic to fix PureSignal auto-attenuate bug
		- removed ADC3 daughterboard references/outputs
		- changed version number to v1.2
		- retimed, compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 14	- fixed XVTR mode bug as follows:
			- assigned TXRX_STATUS to FPGA_PTT and to bit 34 of the 48-bit Alex SPI data word
			- assigned CTRL_TRSW to depend on both FPGA_PTT and C&C C2[1] bit (XVTR_Enable) when C0=0010_010x is set
		- changed FW version number to v1.3
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 17	- modified SPI.v to send the Alex SPI data word twice each time the data word changes
		- changed FW version number to v1.4
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 23	- changed user digital IO connections as follows:
			IO5 = TX INHIBIT, pin 16 of J16, rear 8000DLE panel DIG IN 1
			IO8 = External CW Key, pin 13 of J16, 8000DLE rear panel DIG IN 2
		- changed iambic.v to set IO8 as ext CW key input
		- added debounce to IO5 and IO8
		- changed C122_SHIFT/.c0 phase angle to 11.25 degrees
		- changed output_delay for DACD[*] paths to 1.2 nSec in Orion.sdc
		- changed FW version number to v1.1
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed	

	Apr 14	- added peak detection code for AIN1 (FWD_PWR) and AIN2 (REV_PWR):
			increased clock speed for the Orion_ADC.v module x10 to provide more FWD_PWR, REV_PWR readings per unit time:
			created PLL_30MHz/.c0 to generate a 30.72MHz clock for the Orion_ADC module, results in 7.68MHz SCLK for the ADC
			added peak detect for AIN1 and AIN2 in Orion_ADC.v
			added pk_detect_reset and pk_detect_ack to define peak detection interval based upon the C&C AIN1/2 byte update rate, 
				changes to Orion_Tx_fifo_ctl.v, Orion_ADC.v, and Orion.v to accommodate the peak detect feature
		- changed FW version to v1.6
		- closed timing

	Jul 18	- fixed 6-rcvr & 7-rcvr operations by adding 6-rcvr and 7-rcvr options to numloops and 
			pads in Orion_Tx_fifo_cntrl.v 
		- changed version number to v1.7
		- recompiled, retimed, closed timing. 

	Sep 11	- replaced tx_atten.mif and tx_dac.mif to fix drive level problem

		- re-timed and re-compiled using Quartus Prime Lite v16.1
						
	Nov 10   - added bias_ctrl to control pin 10 (BUFF_OUT) of J16  via U20 and FPGA pin AH30 (BUFF_OUF_FPGA) and
			set it low to enable PA bias on the 7000DLE
		- assigned FPGA pin AH30 to bias_ctrl
